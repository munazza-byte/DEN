## DEN INTERNSHIP TASKS AND PROJECTS OVERVIEW
This repository showcases the projects and tasks undertaken during my six-week internship at Digital Empowerment Network, with a focus on implementing various systems and tools in C++.
### TASK 1: 
### *OBJECTIVE*: Develop a Weather Forecast and Historical Data System that manages locations, weather variables, and historical data, with capabilities for fetching, displaying, and exporting weather information.
+ *DESCRIPTION*:
. Created a comprehensive tool in C++ for weather forecasting and historical data retrieval.
. Integrated API functionality to fetch current weather conditions and historical weather data for various locations.
. Employed libcurl for API interactions and nlohmann/json for JSON data processing.
. Provided features for defining weather variables, managing locations, and exporting data in both CSV and JSON formats.
+ *TECHNOLOGIES USED*: C++, libcurl, nlohmann/json, fstream, API
+ *OUTCOME*: Enabled accurate weather forecasting, efficient data export, and an intuitive interface for managing weather variables and locations.

### TASK 2:  Contacts Handling  System.
### *OBJECTIVE*:
Develop a Contact Handling System that manages a contact list, allowing users to add, remove, and display contacts interactively.
+ *DESCRIPTION*:
  Created a simple Contact Handling System in C++ that allows users to manage a contact list.
  Integrated functionality to add new contacts, remove existing ones, and display the entire list of contacts.
  Employed a vector of Contact objects to store and manage the contact list efficiently.
  Provided a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the system.
  Handled basic input validation and error messages for incorrect choices.
+ *TECHNOLOGIES USED*:C++, vector, I/O streams (iostream).
+ *OUTCOME*:Enabled efficient management of a contact list through a user-friendly interface, facilitating basic operations like adding, removing, and displaying contacts.
